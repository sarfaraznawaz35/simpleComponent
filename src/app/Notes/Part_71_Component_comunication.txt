-> Install Angualr CLI
    npm i @angular/cli
-> Create New Angular application
    ng new <app-name>
-> Run the application

Components
1. Create Angular components
    ng g c header

2. How do you use Angular component
    -> can we change the selector name? 
       'OR' can we pass the customYes of course -> Yes of course
    -> Use the select tag as directive

3. How do you use Angular components from different module?
    - Users module
        -> component -> list-users
    - Import the custom/newly created module into App Module
    - Export the respective components that we want to use outside of the module

4. Angular components communication
    -> @Input and @Output directives
    -> Using services

4.1 @Input and @Output directives
    -> Parent/Child -> Parent -> sending data to child
                    -> Child -> giving back the data to Parent
        -> list-users -> Input -> filter-users
        -> list-users <- Output <- filter-users

    -> We need to pass data from parent using [inputName]
    -> Same need to be defined in the child component as @Input()

    -> Angular components communicate Input and Output

5. Angular component communicate via services
    -> Create a services
        -> ng g service <service-name>
    
    -> Implement methods which can be shared between components for sharing data

6. Angular component lifecycle
    -> Component series of states
        -> Lifecycle hooks
            -> ngOnChanges  -> Listen to changes in data/form/state/value change
            -> ngOnInit     ->  On initialization of the component.
                                everytime a component is initialized loaded and run this ngOnInit
                                so it is on start of the component. So you use this almost 80-90%.
                            -> http call and write subscribe in ngOnInit
                               explanation: Whenever you do a subscription like lot of people attempt
                               to do this, they make http call and write subscribe statements in ngOnInit
                               common mistake: one of the commmon mistake also is that they don't do
                               unsubscribe. So whenever you write a subscribe http call in ngOnInit
                               make sure that you write a ngOnDestroy and you unsubscribe
            -> ngDoCheck
                -> ngAfterContentInit   -> If you want to wait till content initialized
                -> ngAfterContentChecked -> check that if it is loaded   
                -> ngAfterViewInit      -> If the view is completely rendered you can use this
                -> ngAfterViewChecked
            -> ngOnDestroy      ->  when you want to exit the component or whenever you navigate 
                                    away from component you want to use ngOnDestroy 
                -> Unsubscribe the subscription


7. How many ways you can use component template?
